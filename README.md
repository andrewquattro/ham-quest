# ham-quest

Ham-Quest is my CS50 final project. It is a 2d platforming game made in Lua using the Love-2d framework.
In Ham-Quest, your goal is to collect all of the ham on each level and deliver it to the dog to complete the level.
All work was done by Andrew Quattrociocchi, 2022.

You can download and play the full game at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtRmUd8pypmMq51eSD2WMpvi5WSsNtGe/view?usp=sharing.
